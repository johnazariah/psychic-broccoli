## Overview

This repository contains two Python packages designed to streamline data processing workflows and simplify common pipeline operations. Below is an overview of each package, their use cases, and examples to help you quickly integrate them into your project.

## Packages

### 1. **`generics` Package**

#### Description
The `generics` package provides advanced utilities for working with generics and type annotations in Python. It extends the capabilities of Python's `Generic` and `ABC` classes, allowing developers to define, validate, and utilize parameterized types effectively.

#### Features
- Define generic classes with multiple type parameters.
- Validate type annotations and ensure correct usage of type arguments.
- Seamlessly integrate generics with abstract base classes.

#### Installation
To install the `generics` package, use the following command:
```bash
pip install generics
```

#### Quick Start
Here's an example of how to use the `generics` package:
```python
from generics.generics import TypeAnnotatedMeta
from typing import Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")
U = TypeVar("U")

class MyGenericClass(Generic[T, U], metaclass=TypeAnnotatedMeta):
    pass

# Validate type parameters
specialized_class = MyGenericClass[int, str]
print(specialized_class.T, specialized_class.U)  # Output: <class 'int'> <class 'str'>
```

### 2. **`pipeline` Package**

#### Description
The `pipeline` package focuses on building and executing modular data pipelines. It provides tools for defining pipeline stages, managing input-output transformations, and handling execution with contextual data.

#### Features
- Define pipelines as a sequence of customizable stages.
- Support for contextual pipelines that use a shared dictionary to manage stage inputs and outputs.
- Special stages for producing and consuming data at specific points.

#### Installation
To install the `pipeline` package, use the following command:
```bash
pip install pipeline
```

#### Quick Start
Here's an example of how to use the `pipeline` package:
```python
from pipeline.pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline, PipelineStage

class InitialStage(PipelineStage[int, int]):
    def process(self, item):
        return item * 2

class FinalStage(PipelineStage[int, str]):
    def process(self, item):
        return str(item)

pipeline = Pipeline([InitialStage(), FinalStage()])
result = pipeline.run([5, 10])
print(result)  # Output: ['10', '20']
```
